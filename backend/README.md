- `/node_modules` : is the folder where all the dependencies are installed. Don't touch this
- `/backend` : where all the code is, this is the folder who get all our interest here
- `/test` : all tests are here, with mocha and chai

### `/backend`

- Executing `npm run test` for all tests
- Executing `npm run test:mocha` for mocha tests
- Executing `npm run test:lint` for ESLint tests
- Executing `npm-check -u` for check lasted versions in packages

### Standards

- camelCase is the way to go here.
